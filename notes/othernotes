export "x=y" -> will have expansion
export 'x=y' -> will not have expansion
export "$VAR" -> invalid identifier


parsing:
- no expansion between ''
- expansion between ""
- separate items between =


problem:
- need to know when needs to be expanded -> return as different tokens depending on type
- need to know when two tokens are together without space separating

string = "echo -n \"my world is $USER 'yes $USER'\"'$USER' | xargs 'ignore $USER'>>ou>t>>p|ut $PATH 'lols'>|<"
# string = f"echo -n 'ignore $USER' \"account $USER\""
# string = f"echo $USER\"$USER\""
# string = f"export \"name=hello\""
# string = "export name=marcus'mar hen'chicken Yue"
# string = "hello'world'"
